# demo_json_api

Checking the use of a github page to serve static / mostly static API data 

current thoughts are to serve JSON data
will add a react / some other renderer to the front end for humans if needed, but for the moment it is machine only. 

Thoughts for tools 
 - CICD - JSON checker for each file 
        - may need a generated index file to say what's available
